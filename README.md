# React Starting Point

I created this list of simple React example compiled from many resources I can find on the internet.

The example will examine one aspect of react at a time.

Slowly build up bit by bit to more complex features of react.

Function component: Stateless Component. Presentation only component, does not have any state/logic.

Class component: Component that has state. Could have logic and manage the data flow, presentational logic (show/hide)


All the example bootstrap with create-react-app

To Do:
- Organise examples in smaller chunks
- Show example at the very core before showing best practices if best practices are not the most bare way to achieve the desired goal
- Show best practices
